About 8 Years of experience to leverage Computer Vision (OpenCV), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Generative AI (GenAI) for analyzing time series satellite images in Sustainability, Agriculture, and Ecology monitoring:

Employ OpenCV for preprocessing satellite images, including tasks like noise reduction, image enhancement, and feature extraction, to improve the quality of input data for subsequent analysis.

Utilize ML algorithms to classify land use/land cover, detect crop types, and identify ecological features from satellite imagery, enabling insights into environmental changes over time.

Apply DL models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract intricate patterns and structures from satellite images, facilitating the detection of anomalies, crop diseases, and environmental disturbances.

Leverage GenAI techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating synthetic satellite images, augmenting datasets for training ML/DL models and simulating environmental scenarios for predictive analysis.
